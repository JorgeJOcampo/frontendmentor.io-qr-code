## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Learn min() css func and tried to replace media queries with.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  max-width: min(100%, 400px);
}
```

### Awkward things
Use some magic numbers i'm not proud of, for "pixel perfect"
```css
  .container > h1 {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }
  .container > p {
    font-size: 0.9rem;
  }
```
### Useful resources

- [Grid Cheatsheet](https://grid.malven.co/) - Just pick a random cheatsheet from Google, but it's nice
